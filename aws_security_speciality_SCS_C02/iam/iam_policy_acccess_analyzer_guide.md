# AWS IAM Access Analyzer Documentation

## IAM Access Analyzer Overview
- **Purpose**: Identify resources (e.g., Amazon S3 buckets, IAM roles) shared with external entities to reduce unintended access risks.
- **Mechanism**: Uses logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies and generates findings for external access instances.

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer is a tool that helps you set, verify, and refine your IAM policies by providing a suite of capabilities. It includes:**

- IAM Access Analyzer external access analyzers help [identify resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-resource-identification) in your organization and accounts that are shared with an external entity.
- IAM Access Analyzer unused access analyzers help [identify unused access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-unused-access-analysis) in your organization and accounts.
- IAM Access Analyzer [validates IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-policy-validation) against policy grammar and AWS best practices.
- IAM Access Analyzer custom policy checks help [validate IAM policies against your specified security standards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-policy-checks).
- IAM Access Analyzer [generates IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-policy-generation) based on access activity in your AWS CloudTrail logs.

## Key Features

### Findings
- Highlight resources shared externally.
- Include details like resource type, external entity access, and permissions granted.
- Help determine if access is intentional or poses a security risk.

### Policy Analysis
- Automatically analyzes resource-based policies periodically and within 30 minutes of changes.
- Identifies and reports external access not within the defined "zone of trust" (organization or account).

### Dashboard
- Provides a visual summary of findings.
- Displays findings split between public and cross-account access, with a breakdown by resource type.

## Zones of Trust
- The account or organization defined as trusted for the analyzer.
- Internal access within the zone of trust is not flagged as external.

## Policy Updates
- IAM Access Analyzer promptly reviews new or updated policies (approximately within 30 minutes).
- Performs periodic scans to ensure updated access permissions align with security policies.

## Edge Cases and Manual Actions

### Delayed Findings
- Rare delays can occur under specific conditions (e.g., AWS CloudTrail log delivery issues, multi-region S3 access point updates).
- Delays may extend up to 24 hours for periodic scans.

### Manual Resource Rescan
- Trigger a manual scan of resource policies via the "Rescan" link in the Findings dashboard or the `StartResourceScan` API operation.

## Use Cases
- Prevent unintentional access risks.
- Preview policy changes before deployment.
- Monitor findings and take corrective action to resolve access risks.
