# Prometheus Certified Associate (PCA) Guide

## My Thoughts on the Exam

### Why I Took the Exam
I took the exam to expand my knowledge of Prometheus and obtain certification for it. Here are the key takeaways from what I learned:

- Prometheus uses a pull-based metric scraping method.
- It is primarily designed for metric-based monitoring.
- The query language for Prometheus is called PromQL (Prometheus Query Language).

### About the Exam
The exam is 90 minutes long and consists of 60 multiple-gamble questions. You need to score at least 75 out of 100 points to pass. I completed it in 25 minutes and scored 83 points.

If you follow the course and use the practice exams noted in this guide, you should have no issues acing the exam.

## Exam Objectives

### Observability Concepts (18%)
- **Metrics**: Quantitative data points that describe the performance, behavior, or health of a system (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption).
- **Understand logs and events**: Logs provide a detailed record of system activities; events capture state changes or specific occurrences in the system.
- **Tracing and Spans**: Tracing tracks the flow of requests through distributed systems, with spans representing individual operations within a trace.
- **Push vs Pull**: Prometheus primarily pulls metrics from targets, but PushGateway allows push mechanisms for ephemeral jobs.
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically discovers and monitors dynamic infrastructure like cloud instances, containers, or VMs.
- **Basics of SLOs, SLAs, and SLIs**: 
  - **SLI** (Service Level Indicator): Quantifiable measure of service quality (e.g., response time).
  - **SLO** (Service Level Objective): Target value or range for an SLI.
  - **SLA** (Service Level Agreement): Formal contract with consequences for failing to meet SLOs.

### Prometheus Fundamentals (20%)
- **System Architecture**: Prometheus server components include TSDB (storage), HTTP API, and Alertmanager, designed for high availability and scalability.
- **Configuration and Scraping**: Defines how Prometheus collects metrics from targets using `prometheus.yml`.
- **Understanding Prometheus Limitations**: Highlights areas such as lack of native long-term storage or advanced visualization.
- **Data Model and Labels**: Prometheus uses a time-series model with labels (key-value pairs) for identifying and grouping metrics.
- **Exposition Format**: Defines the text-based format for exposing metrics in a Prometheus-readable format.

### PromQL (28%)
- **Selecting Data**: Use expressions to query specific time-series data (e.g., `http_requests_total`).
- **Rates and Derivatives**: Calculate changes over time, like `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`.
- **Aggregating over time**: Summarize data over a time range (e.g., `avg_over_time()`).
- **Aggregating over dimensions**: Group data by specific labels (e.g., `sum by (job)()`).
- **Binary operators**: Perform mathematical operations between time series (e.g., `metric1 + metric2`).
- **Histograms**: Analyze distributions using histogram buckets and `_sum`/`_count` metrics.
- **Timestamp Metrics**: Extract raw timestamps for advanced time-based calculations.

### Instrumentation and Exporters (16%)
- **Client Libraries**: Language-specific libraries for instrumenting custom applications (e.g., Go, Python).
- **Instrumentation**: Adding Prometheus metrics to application code to monitor internal processes.
- **Exporters**: Bridge external systems to Prometheus by exposing their metrics in Prometheus-compatible formats (e.g., Node Exporter).
- **Structuring and naming metrics**: Follow Prometheus conventions for clear, descriptive metric names (e.g., `namespace_subsystem_metric`).

### Alerting & Dashboarding (18%)
- **Dashboarding basics**: Visualize metrics in tools like Grafana for monitoring trends and system health.
- **Configuring Alerting rules**: Set up conditions in Prometheus to trigger alerts when thresholds are breached.
- **Understand and Use Alertmanager**: Route, group, and silence alerts generated by Prometheus.
- **Alerting basics (when, what, and why)**: Establish meaningful alerts to inform critical action without overwhelming noise.
