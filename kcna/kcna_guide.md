# Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) Guide

## My Thoughts on the Exam

### Why I Took the Exam
I took the exam to because I needed a starting point for my Kubestronaut title.

### About the Exam
The exam is very broad and is gonna touch on many topics like:
- Kubernetes itself
- Service Meshes
- Docker
- Containers in general
- Deploments
- Application Management

The exam is 90 minutes long and consists of 60 multiple-gamble questions. You need to score at least 75 out of 100 points to pass. I completed it in 25 minutes and scored 75 points.

- **Serverless**: Understanding serverless technologies in Kubernetes, such as Knative or FaaS solutions.
- **Community and Governance**: Overview of the Kubernetes ecosystem, governance structure, and release cycle.
- **Roles and Personas**: Different user roles in Kubernetes (developers, operators, admins) and their responsibilities.
- **Open Standards**: Understanding standards like OpenAPI, OCI, and how Kubernetes aligns with CNCF principles.

### Cloud Native Observability (8%)
- **Telemetry & Observability**: Tools and techniques for monitoring and logging in Kubernetes (e.g., Fluentd, ELK stack).
- **Prometheus**: Using Prometheus for metrics collection, monitoring, and alerting in Kubernetes.
- **Cost Management**: Strategies for managing and optimizing cloud-native costs effectively.

### Cloud Native Application Delivery (8%)
