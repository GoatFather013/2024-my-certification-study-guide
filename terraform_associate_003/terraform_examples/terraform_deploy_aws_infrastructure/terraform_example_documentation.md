# Example Documentation

This document provides an overview of all configuration files, their roles, interactions, the provider used, and the deployment target.

---

## Overview
- **Provider**: The project utilizes the **AWS** provider for cloud infrastructure management.
- **Deployment Target**: Infrastructure is deployed to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, using services like EC2, Route 53, IAM, and others.

## File Descriptions and Interactions

### 11. **vpc.tf**
- **Purpose**: Manages the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and associated networking resources.
- **Functionality**:
  - Configures subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
  - Sets up the foundation for networking within the AWS environment.
- **Interactions**:
  - Provides networking configurations used by `instances.tf`, `loadbalancer.tf`, and `securitygroups.tf`.
  - Uses variables defined in `variables.tf`.



### 1. **main.tf**
- **Purpose**: Serves as the main Terraform configuration file.
- **Functionality**:
  - Declares the provider (AWS).
  - Orchestrates resource creation, including instances, networking, and other infrastructure.
- **Interactions**:
  - Uses variables from `variables.tf`.
  - Links to other resources such as `instances.tf`, `securitygroups.tf`, and `route53.tf`.

---

### 2. **variables.tf**
- **Purpose**: Defines all input variables for modular and reusable configurations.
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides flexibility by parameterizing values for instance size, region, VPC IDs, etc.
- **Interactions**:
  - Referenced in `main.tf`, `securitygroups.tf`, and other modules for consistent configuration.

---

### 3. **outputs.tf**
- **Purpose**: Captures key outputs from the Terraform deployment.
- **Functionality**:
  - Outputs details like public IPs, DNS names, or resource ARNs after infrastructure deployment.
- **Interactions**:
  - Values are derived from resources defined in `main.tf` and other modules.
  - Outputs are used for post-deployment tasks and monitoring.

---

### 4. **securitygroups.tf**
- **Purpose**: Configures security groups for controlling traffic.
- **Functionality**:
  - Defines rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Secures instances and load balancers.
- **Interactions**:
  - Used by `instances.tf` and `loadbalancer.tf` to associate security groups with resources.

---

### 5. **route53.tf**
- **Purpose**: Manages DNS entries using AWS Route 53.
- **Functionality**:
  - Automates DNS record creation for instances and load balancers.
  - Supports both public and private zones.
- **Interactions**:
  - Outputs from `outputs.tf` are used to configure DNS entries dynamically.

---

### 6. **loadbalancer.tf**
- **Purpose**: Configures AWS load balancers for traffic distribution.
- **Functionality**:
  - Sets up target groups, listeners, and health checks for instances.
  - Distributes traffic across EC2 instances.
- **Interactions**:
  - Utilizes instances from `instances.tf` and security groups from `securitygroups.tf`.

---

### 7. **instancerole.tf**
- **Purpose**: Defines IAM roles and policies for EC2 instances.
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides permissions for instances to interact with AWS services.
- **Interactions**:
  - Attaches the custom policy defined in `k8s_cni_policy.json`.

---

### 8. **instances.tf**
- **Purpose**: Manages EC2 instance creation.
- **Functionality**:
  - Configures instances with AMIs, instance types, and networking options.
  - Associates instances with security groups and IAM roles.
- **Interactions**:
  - Links to `securitygroups.tf` and `instancerole.tf`.

---

### 9. **k8s_cni_policy.json**
- **Purpose**: JSON policy file for Kubernetes CNI plugin.
- **Functionality**:
  - Grants permissions for managing network interfaces in AWS.
- **Interactions**:
  - Used in `instancerole.tf` to configure EC2 IAM roles.

---

### 10. **Other Uploaded Files**
#### **output.tf**
- Similar in purpose to `outputs.tf`, capturing key outputs for use in automation or manual configurations.

---

## Summary of Interactions
1. **Provider**:
   - The AWS provider is initialized and configured in `main.tf`.
2. **Variables**:
   - Modularize configurations using `variables.tf`.
3. **Resources**:
   - `main.tf` acts as the orchestrator, linking individual resource configurations.
4. **Policies**:
   - IAM roles and permissions in `instancerole.tf` integrate the JSON policy from `k8s_cni_policy.json`.
5. **Outputs**:
   - Defined in `outputs.tf` and `output.tf` for post-deployment use.

---

### How to Use
1. Set the AWS provider configuration in `main.tf`.
2. Customize inputs in `variables.tf`.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
4. Execute `terraform plan` to preview changes.
5. Deploy using `terraform apply`.
